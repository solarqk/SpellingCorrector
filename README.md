# SpellingCorrector

The Spelling Corrector is a Java program that uses a Trie data structure to store words from a dictionary file and their frequencies. It corrects misspelled words by suggesting the most likely word from the dictionary, based on edit distance and frequency of occurrence. The program provides functionality to add words to the Trie, check for correct spelling, and find the most similar word if a given word is not found in the dictionary.
